<h3>What does the graph mean?</h3>
<p>Using topic modeling I was able to determine the topic mixture for each text. For example, lets say I had a text that was the transcript of a political speech in a corpus of several speeches. If the topics for that corpus were approximately about reelection, taxes, dogs, and education, we might expect the political speech text to be a high percentage reelection, a medium percentage taxes or education, and a low percentage for dogs.</p>
<p>The graph has the chapters (or books, depending on what has been selected) across the x-axis in order, and has the afore mentioned percentages along the y-axis. Thus each line on the graph shows shows how the percentage of that topic changes of the course of the texts that were selected. If the line starts out close to the bottom, and ends towards the top, this would indicate that the selected topic started out being relatively unimportant, or at least not spoken about, and ended up being very important at the end of the selection.</p>

<h3>Can you really use data science to analyze literature?</h3>
<p>This is question almost always asked when quantitative techniques are used to analyze literature. The goal of these quantitative approaches, however, is not to replace critical reading and hueristic analysis, but to simply augment them. For example, an approach such as topic modeling ignores the order of words. Obviously, any human reader is going to tell you that the order in which an author uses words can have a huge effect on the final piece. This is not a flaw in topic modeling exactly (its kind of the whole point) but it definitely goes to show how a lot of nuance can be lost when a model is used to represent a written work.
</p>

<p>This idea is summed up in a famous (to data scientists at least) quote by George Box in 1987:</p>
<q> Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are usful.</q>

<p>One of the strengths of topic modeling however, is that it lets you analyze a much greater amount of text. For example, it would have been nearly impossoble to read the 12 volumes of A History of Middle-earth as a human, but it takes about a minute to run topic modeling on it. The results can then be used almost as a summarization tool.</p>
