<p>Topic Modeling is a way to analyze a large body of text without having to information about the content in the texts. It works by looking at the entire corpus and creating clusters of words that appear together frequently. Then for each text, the mixture (or weighting) of each topic is determined based on which words are present in the document. Since topic modeling is based on word proximity and frequeency, the algorithm can differentiate between homonyms. Additionally, words such as 'the', 'its', and 'becuase' (called stopwords) were not considered, so the focus would stay on the more interesting topic defining words.

<h3>Terminology:</h3>
<p>
<b>Topic:</b> Unlike the normal usage of the word 'topic', in the context of topic modeling a topic is an abstract list of words that have been clustered together statistically. Although it is tempting to look at the group of words and assign it a label such as "characters from the hobbit", this can be risky.<br><br>

<b>Corpus:</b> All the texts used in a topic modeling. Topic modeling is the most useful when the corpus consists of a lot of text files<br><br>

<b>Text:</b> One element of the corpus. In this case, a text file containing either one chapter or an entire book.<br><br>

<b>MALLET:</b> Stands for MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit. A command line software package the uses numerical optimization and the LDA algorithm to compute the topics and their weights.<br><br>

<b>LDA:</b> Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The type of topic model used in this project. It works under the assumption that texts consist of a combination of topics, and words' presence in the docement is a result of that.<br><br>
